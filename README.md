# Froggy
A discord bot that will tell you when it's Wednesday

# Configuration
To make this work correctly, you'll need to create a new file called config.json and include json elements such as:
- discord_token
- yt_playlist
- yt_api_key

Froggy/appsettings.json
```json
ï»¿{
	"DiscordToken": "",
	"YtPlaylist": "",
	"YtApiKey": ""
}
```
